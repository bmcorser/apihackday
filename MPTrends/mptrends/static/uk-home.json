        "body":"<p>The children of Lord Lucan, the fugitive aristocrat who murdered his nanny, twice travelled to Africa so their father could secretly see them, according to a BBC documentary.</p><p>A woman who worked for Lucan's close friend, John Aspinall, said that she arranged trips between 1979 and 1981 for safaris in Kenya, followed by a trip to Gabon where Lucan would be able to observe his children without them knowing.</p><p>Lucan disappeared in 1974 after the body of Sandra Rivett was found at his home in Belgravia, London. His wife said that he had attacked her and killed Ms Rivett. His car was later found abandoned in Newhaven, East Sussex.</p><p>Aspinall's secretary, who asked not to be identified and has assumed the name Jill Findlay, said she was invited into meetings where Lucan was discussed by her boss and Sir James Goldsmith, a businessman and close friend of Lucan's.</p><p>\"Instructions were to make arrangements for John Bingham, also known as Lord Lucan, to see his children. To do that I had to book his two eldest children on flights to Africa,\" she told the BBC. Lucan had three children, Frances, born in 1964, George, born in 1967 and Camilla, born in 1970.</p><p>\"I don't know the exact dates, it was between 1979 and 1981 and it was on two occasions I booked the flights.\"</p><p>Findlay said she had \"no idea of the enormity\" of the search under way for Lucan, who was then the most wanted man in Britain.</p><p>There have been scores of sightings of Lord Lucan since his disappearance, mostly in Africa. There is also much suspicion that he was helped to escape by his circle of wealthy friends, which included Aspinall and Goldsmith.</p><p>In an interview shortly before his death in 2000, Aspinall said he thought Lucan had probably scuttled his boat in the English Channel. Goldsmith died three years earlier. Lucan was declared dead in 1999.</p><p>Findlay said she decided to talk to the BBC as she had reflected on her life during a recent illness and wanted to pass on information to whoever might find it of interest.</p><p>She said her conscience was clear because she had not helped Lucan escape and was prepared to give Scotland Yard a statement.</p><p>BBC's Inside Out also interviewed Bob Polkinghorne, a former detective inspector who worked on the Lucan inquiry in the 1980s, who said he was prevented from following up leads by his superiors.</p><p>He said further confirmation that Lucan was alive came from a reliable witness who saw one of Lucan's close acquaintances in the early 1980s as he holidayed in Africa.</p><p>\"He was surprised to see this acquaintance standing on a bridge,\" said Polkinghorne, \"After two to three minutes, he was joined by another man, whom he is adamant was Lord Lucan.\"</p><p>Polkinghorne, who now lives in Kent, said permission to pursue this lead was refused by the Metropolitan police. He said: \"I was then later told, a few days later, discontinue the inquiry. You haven't got approval to continue.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/uk&k=Crime&k=UK+news&k=London\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Lord+Lucan+%27lived+secret+life+in+Africa%27%2C+claims+former+assistant+Article+1705798&ch=UK+news&c2=134313&c4=Crime+-+UK+%28News%29%2CUK+news%2CLondon+%28News%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Conal+Urquhart&c7=12-Feb-18&c8=1705798&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: uk/2012/feb/18/lord-lucan-secret-life-africa|2012-02-18T15:32:59Z|f127b8740a4133a180de71c3c4c41dfdaae8e8b9 -->",

        "body":"<p>A female former gang member has exposed the growing levels of sexual violence against young women who join them, saying that many are willing to risk being raped in return for the status of membership.</p><p>Isha Nembhard, who was part of an 80-strong gang in Peckham, south London, said some girls readily accepted that they would be sexually abused when associating with male gangs.</p><p>The 20-year-old said that the problem had reached a point where being raped was becoming \"normalised\" among many young women. \"Girls who are getting treated very badly know what they are getting into. They sleep with a boy and the boy asks if she will sleep with all his friends.</p><p>\"It's about low self-esteem and a craving for attention. Even if they know it's wrong, they will do anything to get acceptance,\" she said.</p><p>\"A lot of girls are sort of prostituting themselves to have sexual relationships within a gang and get treated in a bad way. For example, she might know about what happens to girls in the gang but still sleeps with all of them just for the status.\"</p><p>Nembhard, who was a teenage drug dealer, said that even those who are abused and called \"pieces of shit\" by gang members maintained sexual relationships with them because they felt \"that they couldn't do better\".</p><p>She added that cultural and social trends had exacerbated the problem since she left school. \"When I was growing up, girls were more boisterous. I used to be a tomboy, but nowadays a lot of girls who go to school are more girly-girly and make sure they put on their makeup and wear the right sort of skirts. It's changed dramatically.\"</p><p>Nembhard said that girls tended to be more sexually active before the age of 16 than before. \"In my day it wasn't like that,\" she said.</p><p>Social networking sites like Facebook had, she added, helped to encourage promiscuity among young women. \"You've got young gi rls exposing themselves on there, making it normal, and so others follow suit.\"</p><p>Earlier this month the home secretary, Theresa May, announced Â£1.2m of new money over three years to tackle the issue as part of the government's revamped anti-gangs strategy.</p><p>Meanwhile, a senior Scotland Yard officer has voiced concern that the problem of young women being sexually abused by male gangs had grown sufficiently large to be classified as a \"mainstream issue\".</p><p>The Metropolitan Police detective in charge of protecting vulnerable young women from falling into gang culture, Detective Chief Inspector Petrina Cribb, said that, although police were targeting girls as young as 12 to warn them of the risks associated with male gangs, she believed that educating youngsters of the dangers should begin even earlier, at primary school.</p><p>Cribb also admitted concern about the levels of ignorance among young women about sexual abuse, saying that many did not understand that being forced to give oral sex was rape. Cribb, who manages the Met's Heart programme, which educates young people about the risks associated with joining gangs, added: \"A lot of young people do not know what is the law, particularly with regard to being coerced into oral sex, which is rape, but some think it is just playing around.</p><p>\"Young girls find that they may have no choice \u2013 a young girl who is surrounded by a group of boys might feel it's normal to go along with it.\"</p><p>Former girl gang members say that despite being aware of the risks many girls with low self-esteem are willing to risk being raped by entire gangs to increase their \"status\".</p><p>The Heart programme, which involves police, local authorities and charities, aims to teach women about relationship issues, rather than the traditional emphasis on sex education. Already 180 girls identified as at risk have begun one-on-one tutorials for the rest of the year, with another 725 workshop places available to teach girls what is unacceptable in a relationship.</p><p>The scheme has so far been introduced in three London boroughs \u2013 Lewisham, Newham and Waltham Forest \u2013 but Cribb said she felt \"very strongly\" that every school should be delivering a form of relationship education to empower young women. \"We are trying to explain that girls actually have a choice and that consent is key to a sexual relationship,\" she said.</p><p>Gifford Sutherland of community group Foundation 4 Life, which uses reformed former gang members to educate vulnerable youngsters, said sexual abuse was not the only risk that gangs posed to girls. \"Not only are girlfriends manipulated by young men for sex, but they become associates, hiding firearms, carrying drugs, and sometimes these young girls find that they have no choice.</p><p>\"The key concern is that this sort of behaviour has been normalised, that they go through an initiation process or they are coerced into sex. We show that is not a healthy relationship.\"</p><p>Although the Met has no detailed data on the numbers of potential victims, it believes that the estimated 250 active criminal gangs in the capital account for one in seven reported rapes. A survey by the NSPCC has suggested that a third of teenage girls have been forced into sexual activity against their will, while research by the Race on the Agenda charity shows that rape is used to punish girl gang members.</p><p>However, those with first-hand experience of the way in which gangs operate say that the factors driving such abuse are complex.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/society&k=Gangs&k=Young+people&k=Sexual+health&k=London&k=Society&k=Sex+education\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/society/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/society/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=%27Being+raped+by+a+gang+is+normal+%E2%80%93+it%27s+about+craving+to+be+accepted%27+Article+1705757&ch=Society&c2=134313&c4=Gangs+%28Society%29%2CYoung+people+%28Society%29%2CSexual+health+%28Society%29%2CLondon+%28News%29%2CSociety%2CSex+education%2CCommunities+%28Society%29%2CUK+news%2CEducation&c3=The+Observer&c6=Mark+Townsend%2C+home+affairs+editor&c7=12-Feb-18&c8=1705757&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: society/2012/feb/18/being-raped-by-gang-normal|2012-02-18T15:32:59Z|ae33225440fec654e85219536e826ce279ea8503 -->",

But they admitted that the quality of the opposition leadership in and outside Syria is hampering efforts to provide support.</p><p>No 10 officials have met the divided Syrian opposition in London and came away unimpressed by comparison with the Libyan opposition.</p><p>Sarkozy said: \"We cannot bring about a Syrian revolution ... if the Syrian revolution does not make an effort to rally together and organise so that we can better help them.</p><p>\"The principle obstacle ... is not just the blockage at the UN. In Libya we couldn't have had the revolution without the Libyans and we won't be able to have a Syrian revolution without the Syrian opposition making enough effort to unite that we can support them more.\"</p><p>\"We will not accept that a dictator massacres his people, but the revolution will not be led from outside. Like in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, it must be led from the inside.''</p><p>British officials have said the Free Syrian Army, \"is neither free nor an army\".</p><p>\"What is happening in Syria is appalling,\" Cameron told a news conference. \"I'm not satisfied that we are taking all the action we can.\"</p><p>In a joint statement, Cameron and Sarkozy pledged that their countries \"will continue to increase their engagement with the Syrian opposition, including encouraging the opposition to work together and to support the vision of an inclusive, prosperous and free Syria\".

        "headline":"Labour's Maria Eagle backs two-thirds of coalition's transport spending cuts",
        "body":"<p>Maria Eagle, one of Ed Miliband's earliest supporters in the shadow cabinet, has said she backs transport spending cuts worth Â£6bn, and warned that Labour will not be elected unless it has credibility on the deficit and recognises the new economic reality.</p><p>In a Guardian interview, the shadow transport secretary said she supported two-thirds of the cuts being introduced by the coalition government, although she had some sharp differences in priority. It is the largest cuts programme both in absolute and proportional terms put forward by any shadow cabinet member.</p><p>It is also remarkable because it comes from someone on the left of the party, and follows a period of silence on the deficit from senior party figures since two initiatives by Ed Miliband and Ed Balls early in January.</p><p>Until now only the shadow defence secretary, Jim Murphy, had set out a wide-ranging cuts programme, and he is seen as a figure on what was once the Blairite wing.</p><p>Polls show Labour trails the Conservatives badly as the party considered to be best equipped to take tough decisions.</p><p>Eagle also committed to make spending pledges only by switching resources within the budget and \"by being open with the public about what this will require to be cut\". She promised that if elected after 2015 she would find extra resources only by being tough with the vested interests in the train and bus companies, and not by seeking resources from the Treasury.</p><p>She said there was \"a something for nothing culture\" across transport, where train companies made big profits off high levels of public subsidy and felt they had no responsibility. \"That has got to change. They are making big profits out of Â£4bn of public subsidy. It is not as if they are succeeding purely through their entrepreneurship,\" Eagle said.</p><p>\"The reality of the deficit means that we are facing a very different landscape from when we were in government. Reducing the deficit requires us to support cuts in spending that we might not have in the past. Some of this is painful,\" she said. \"I have identified over Â£6bn of reductions in the Department of Transport budget that we will not oppose, out of the Â£9bn the government has proposed. That is two-thirds that I am supporting.</p><p>\"There is no division on this. This is not being driven by a particular faction of the shadow cabinet. It is not something just Blairities think. We all have a responsibility to set out how we would meet the challenge of the deficit within our areas of policy and I have done so in transport. Some of these are painful cuts.\"</p><p>Eagle said she supported Â£528m efficiency cuts in Network Rail, Â£245m cuts in CrossRail, Â£3.36bn cuts in the Highways Agency roads programme, Â£794m efficiencies in the roads maintenance programme, Â£1.73bn cuts in the Transport for London budget and Â£231m in the local authority roads programme. All the figures apply to the spending round.</p><p>She said she opposed Â£759m cuts in Network Rail and would use the cash to keep rail fares down. She said she would have retained Â£500m planned government cuts in the roads programme, and some cash for safe cycle lanes and an electric car-charging network.</p><p>\"I give these detailed figures not to show to the media we see the importance of deficit credibility, but because we think it is the right thing to do. We are going to inherit this. The next parliament is not about redistributing the proceeds of growth. At the next election we are going to have to be tougher than Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, and think about ways of how we can deliver more with less. That is the key challenge we face, and we have to get into that mindset. It means being bolder about responsible capitalism.\"</p><p>Eagle said after the election she would squeeze the rail companies by refusing to give them the right to lift the fares cap, and get the bus companies to support concessionary fares for 16- to 18-years-olds in education and training.</p><p>She promised to bring the bus network outside London back under some form of democratic control, as it is in the capital. She said her proposals represented \"the biggest devolution of power in transport since Barbara Castle in the late 70s\".</p><p>Eagle said: \"I think it is mad that the Department of Transport awards regional rail franchises and designs new trains. It is mad that ministers have to sign off every new road and rail scheme in England and Wales. Local authorities then have to engage consultants to lobby ministers to OK their roads.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/politics&k=Labour&k=Transport+policy&k=Transport&k=Politics&k=Public+sector+cuts&k=Society\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/politics/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/politics/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Labour%27s+Maria+Eagle+backs+two-thirds+of+coalition%27s+transport+spending+cuts+Article+1705674&ch=Politics&c2=134313&c4=Labour%2CTransport+policy%2CTransport+UK+news%2CPolitics%2CPublic+sector+cuts+%28Society%29%2CSociety%2CUK+news&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Patrick+Wintour&c7=12-Feb-17&c8=1705674&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: politics/2012/feb/17/labour-maria-eagle-transport-spending-cuts|2012-02-18T15:32:59Z|806602de5bd250b0bfd05e0f5074cd9c5ca44fb8 -->",
